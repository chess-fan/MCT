Welcome to MCT (Managing ChessCoin tasks)
* internal code name: reviving ChessCoin (community)

# goal
I'll list here [tasks](https://github.com/chess-fan/MCT/issues) which need to be done to bring ChessCoin to a better level.

You can sort the tasks by category (see [here](https://github.com/chess-fan/MCT/labels)), e.g.:
* [help wanted](https://github.com/chess-fan/MCT/labels/help%20wanted)
* [testing](https://github.com/chess-fan/MCT/labels/testing)
* [security](https://github.com/chess-fan/MCT/labels/security)

Bugs and such still belong to the [bug tracker](https://github.com/coinforchess/chesscoin/issues).
